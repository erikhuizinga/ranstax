## About

Many board games contain various sets or modules of items to be shuffled, like cards.
When setting up a game, it is tedious to (un)merge and shuffle them together.
Ranstax simplifies this by allowing you to keep all these stacks completely separated.
You just select the stacks to use, shuffle them separately, and use Ranstax to determine from which stack(s) to draw.

It's that easy.
This speeds up game setup and shuffling, increases shuffling efficiency, and storage of the game: stacks can remain separated forever.

Did you know that shuffling becomes really inefficient with a growing number of items?
Numberphile on YouTube did an excellent video on this:

Summary of the video: don't do an overhand shuffle, but a riffle/mash shuffle instead.

Some examples of board games that this works with:
- Wingspan
- Everdell
- Carcassone
